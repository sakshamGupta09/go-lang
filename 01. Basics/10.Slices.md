# Slices or Dynamic Arrays

- Often, we do not know how beforehand the size of our arrays. So, we need dynamic and flexible arrays that can store multiple values and can dynamically increase or decrease their sizes.


## Syntax

### Declaration without initialization]

- Size is not specified.
- Unlike arrays, there will be no elements with default values.

```go
var a []int8
fmt.Println(a) // []
```
