# Slices or Dynamic Arrays

- Often, we do not know how beforehand the size of our arrays. So, we need dynamic and flexible arrays that can store multiple values and can dynamically increase or decrease their sizes.


## Syntax

### Declaration without initialization

- Size is not specified.
- Unlike arrays, there will be no elements with default values.

```go
var a []int8
fmt.Println(a) // []
```

## Initilaization

```go
func main() {
	var a []int8 = []int8{1, 2, 3, 4}

	fmt.Println(a) // [1,2,3,4]
}

```
