# For loop

- When we know beforehand the number of iterations we need to do.
- A loop typically has initialization, condition, body and increment logic.

```go
func main() {
	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```

## Break

- To come out of the loop before completion. It will terminate the loop and start executing next statement.
- Whenever `break` statement is encountered, loop gets terminated immediately and flow shifts to statements after loop.

```go
func main() {
	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		if i == 3 {
			break
		}
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
	fmt.Println("LOOP OVER")
}

```

## Continue

- Whenever `continue` keyword is executed, it will stop executing any statements in the loop body for current iteration and will move to next iteration.

```go
func main() {
	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		if i%2 == 0 {
			continue
		}
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
	fmt.Println("LOOP OVER")
}

```


## Unknown number of iterations

- Go doesn't have different loops like while, do while.
- For loop is mature enough in Go to handle all these variations.

```go
func main() {
	var i int = 0
	for i <= 5 {
		fmt.Println(i)
		i++
	}
	fmt.Println("LOOP OVER")
}
```

## Infinite loop

```go
func main() {
	var sum int = 0
	for {
		sum += 10
		fmt.Println("SUM ", sum)
		if sum > 50 {
			break
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("LOOP OVER")
}
```
