# For loop

- When we know beforehand the number of iterations we need to do.

```go
func main() {
	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```

## Break

- To come out of the loop before completion. It will terminate the loop and start executing next statement.
- Whenever `break` statement is encountered, loop gets terminated immediately and flow shigts to statements after loop.

```go
func main() {
	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		if i == 3 {
			break
		}
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
	fmt.Println("LOOP OVER")
}

```

## Continue

- Whenever `continue` keyword is executed, it will stop executing any statements in the loop body for current iteration and will move to next iteration.
