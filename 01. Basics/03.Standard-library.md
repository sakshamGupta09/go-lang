# Standard Library

- Go installation comes with a set of predefined utilities that we can use in our programs. Those utilities are made available to us via standard library.
- This library offers some functionalities that can be used in our programs like `fmt`, `net/http`.

## Import

- To use the utilities provided by standard library, we first need to import them.
- When we import a package, all it's offerings (functions, variables, types, constants etc.) are made available to us.
- It's possible that we just need few utils from the package and not all of them. In that case only the parts we use will end up in our bundle and not the entire package content. This is called tree shaking. Go compiler handles it for us.


```go
import "fmt"
```

## Multiple imports

```go
import "fmt"
import "net/http"
```

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)
```

## Named imports

```go
import (
	logger "fmt"
)

func main() {
	logger.Println("Hello World")
}

```
