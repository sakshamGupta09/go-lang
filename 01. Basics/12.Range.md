# Range

- It's a convinient function that lets us iterate over collections like arrays, slices, maps, channels, strings.
- It provides a uniform way of iterating over collections for which otherwise we would need different syntax for different collections.

## Syntax

- `for i,v := range collection`


## Iterating over strings

- The value returned is the uniocode value of character.

```go
func main() {
	message := "Hello World"

	for i, v := range message {

		fmt.Println(i, v)

		/*
		   0 72
		   1 101
		   2 108
		   3 108
		   4 111
		   5 32
		   6 87
		   7 111
		   8 114
		   9 108
		   10 100
		*/
	}
}
```
