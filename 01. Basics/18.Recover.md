# Recover from panic

- After a `panic`, our program terminates. That means if during our program execution, a runtime panic happens, our program will terminate.
- `recover` lets us handle the panic gracefully, log it if we want and the program execution continues.


## Syntax

- recover function returns the panic value if a panic happened.
- If there is no panic, then the recover function returns `nil`.

```go
func recovery() {
	if r := recover(); r != nil {
	}
}
```
