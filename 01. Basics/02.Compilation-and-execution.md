# GO run command

## Compilation

- We write code in high level programming language like GO but computers do not understand them.
- Computers only understand machine language.
- So, we need to convert our source code into machine readable code.
- Go compiler does that. It takes GO source code and produces a binary executable which machines can understand and execute.

## Go Runtime

- Compilation produces machine readable code then why do we need runtime?
- We need runtime to manage certain aspects of program execution like Memory management, Garbage collection, concurrency, provide runtime libraries and ensuring cross platform compatibility.

## GO Build

- Compiler compiles GO source code and generates a binary executable file that is stored in our disk.
- This executable then needs to be run manually.
- Useful when we are done with local development and want to deploy our binary executable to staging or production.

## Go Run

- Single step to compile the source code and execute the binary executable.
- First, the complier will compile the source code into binary executable but that executable is not explicitly stored in our disk. The executable gets stored in RAM.
- After compilation is successful, it executes the binary.
- Once execution finsishes, the file is deleted from RAM.
- Useful while local development.
