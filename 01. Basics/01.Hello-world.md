# How does Go works

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() { fmt.Println("Hello World") }

```

## package main (package declaration)

Programs in GO can be executable(runnable programs) or libraries. `package main` tells the Go compiler that this package produces an executable binary.


## func main

Main function is the entry point for any GO application. Execution always starts from main function. Whenever we run any GO application, the compiler looks for main function and starts execution.
