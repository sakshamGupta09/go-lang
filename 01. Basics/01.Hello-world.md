# How does Go works

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() { fmt.Println("Hello World") }

```
- Let’s understand how this Go program actually runs, step by step

## 1️⃣ Compilation (go build or go run)

- Parses the code → checks syntax.
- Type checks → ensures types are correct.
- Go compiles directly to native machine code. No interpreter, no VM (unlike Java).
- Links dependencies → includes required packages like fmt.
- Produces a single executable binary.

```go
[ Your Code ] + [ Go Runtime ] + [ Standard Library ]
```
- The final executable has 3 components, Let's understand them now.


## Go Runtime

The Go runtime is a small system embedded inside the final binary that provides:

- **Automatic memory management and Garbage collection.** In languages like C, we manually have to allocalte and free memory. Go runtime handles that for us.
- Goroutine Scheduler and concurrency management.
- Stack Management
- Panic & Recover
- Initialization & Startup. Before main.main() runs: Runtime sets up memory, Initializes scheduler and Prepares GC.
