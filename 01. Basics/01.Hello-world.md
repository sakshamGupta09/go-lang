# How does Go works

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() { fmt.Println("Hello World") }

```
- Let’s understand how this Go program actually runs, step by step

## 1️⃣ Compilation (go build or go run)

- Parses the code → checks syntax.
- Type checks → ensures types are correct.
- Go compiles directly to native machine code. No interpreter, no VM (unlike Java).
- Links dependencies → includes required packages like fmt.
- Produces a single executable binary.

Even though compiler produces a binary executable, we need Go Runtime also for program execution unlike C.

## Go Runtime

- The Go runtime is a small system embedded inside the final binary that provides:
- Automatic memory management and Garbage collection.
- Goroutine Scheduler and concurrency management.
- Stack Management
- Panic & Recover
- Initialization & Startup. Before main.main() runs: Runtime sets up memory, Initializes scheduler and Prepares GC.


```go
[ Your Code ] + [ Go Runtime ] + [ Standard Library ]
```
