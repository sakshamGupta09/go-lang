# How does Go works

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() { fmt.Println("Hello World") }

```
- Let’s understand how this Go program actually runs, step by step

## Compilation (go build or go run)

- Parses the code → checks syntax.
- Type checks → ensures types are correct.
- Go compiles directly to native machine code.No interpreter, no VM (unlike Java). Binary includes Go runtime
- Links dependencies → includes required packages like fmt.
- Produces a single executable binary.


## Program Startup (Runtime Initialization)

### When you execute the binary:

- The OS loads the binary into memory.
