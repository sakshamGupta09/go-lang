# Returning multiple values

- Sometimes, we might need to return multiple values from a function.
- We would generally use composite types like maps, objects or arrays to return multiple values and later destructure them.
- Error handling. We can resturn a result and an error from a function. Perform some logic, if it goes well give back teh result else give back the error.


```go
func main() {
	q, r := divide(10, 3)
	fmt.Println(q, r)

}

func divide(x int, y int) (int, int) {
	quotient := x / y
	remainder := x % y
	return quotient, remainder
}
```
