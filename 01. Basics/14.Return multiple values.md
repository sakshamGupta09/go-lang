# Returning multiple values

- Sometimes, we might need to return multiple values from a function.
- We would generally use composite types like maps, objects or arrays to return multiple values and later destructure them.
- Error handling. We can resturn a result and an error from a function. Perform some logic, if it goes well give back teh result else give back the error.
