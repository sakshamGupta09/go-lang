# Exit

- Terminate the program immediately with a status code. It’s typically used when the program must stop right now.
- Status zero means success and non zero means a failiure.
- No cleanups or defer functions registered will be executed. It's not possible to recover from exit.

```go
func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("AFTER EXIT??")

	fmt.Println("START MAIN")
	os.Exit(0)
	fmt.Println("AFTER EXIT")
}
```
