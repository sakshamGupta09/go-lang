# Variables

- A program needs to store, read and modify data over time. Variables helps us do that.
- They also define the structure and type of data they will be holding and provide type safety.

## Unitialized variable declaration

```go
var age int
fmt.Println(age)
```
- Unitialized variables take the default value based on the type.


## Initialized variable declaration

```go
var firstName = "saksham"
var lastName string = "Gupta"
```
- If we are initialzing variable, it's optional to specift type as it will infer from the value assigned.

## Multiple variables declaration

- If we want to create multiple variables of same type, we can use this syntax.

```go
func main() {
	var a, b int = 10, 20
	fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```


## Shorthand

- No need to write `var` keyword and define the type as it will be infered from the value.
- This syntax is only valid inside functions. Package level variables are still declared using `var` keyword.

```go
count := 10
```

## Constants

- A value that is not gonna change during program execution.
- Constant variables are declared with `const` keyword.
- Constants must be initialized.
- Constants can be typed as well as non typed or infered.

```go
const AGE = 18;
```

## Multiple constants

- Related constants can be grouped into a single block.

```go
const (
  name = "saksham"
  age int  = 14
)
```
