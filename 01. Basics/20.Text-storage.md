# How text works in programming

- Computers can only store bytes. They can't store strings or characters.
- We need a way to convert characters to bytes.

### 1️⃣ Step 1: Unicode assigns a number to every character

- Each and every character in this world, be it in any language or even emojis, gets assigned a unique number(code point).

### 2️⃣ Step 2: UTF-8 converts that number into bytes

- Computers stores bytes not code points. So, we need to convert code points to bytes.
- UTF-8 takes a code point as input and returns it's byte representation.
- Not all characters take 1 byte, Usually english alphabets take 1 byte.

| Code point range | Bytes used |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| 0–127            | 1 byte     |
| 128–2047         | 2 bytes    |
| 2048–65535       | 3 bytes    |
| 65536+           | 4 bytes    |


### 3️⃣ Example 1 — Simple ASCII

```go
s := "A"
fmt.Println([]byte(s)) // [65]
```
- `A` represented by 65 and `a` by 97.
- For 0–127, UTF-8 stores the same number directly.

### 4️⃣ Example 2 — Hindi character

```go
s := "न"
fmt.Println([]byte(s)) // [224 164 168]

'न' = U+0928 = 2344
```
- UTF-8 converts 2344 into: `224 164 168`. These 3 bytes together represent this character.
