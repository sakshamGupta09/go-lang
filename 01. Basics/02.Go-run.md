# GO run command

## How is GO source code executed?

- The source code is compiled into a binary executable (Compilation).
- That executable can then run on any machine (Execution).

## GO Build

- Compiler compiles GO source code and generates a binary executable file that is stored in our disk.
- This executable then needs to be run manually.
- Useful when we are done with local development and want to deploy our binary executable to staging or production.

## Go Run

- Single step to compile the source code and execute the binary executable.
- First, the complier will compile the source code into binary executable but that executable is not explicitly stored in our disk. The executable gets stored in RAM.
- After compilation is successful,
