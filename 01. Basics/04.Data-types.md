# Data types

Programs generally create and manipulate data. It's important top understand different types of data that we can store in our program.


## Variables

- Variables are used to access data.

## Unitialized variable declaration

```go
var age int
fmt.Println(age)
```

## Initialized variable declaration

```go
var firstName = "saksham"
var lastName string = "Gupta"
```
If we are initialzing variable, it's optional to specift type as it will infer from the value assigned.
