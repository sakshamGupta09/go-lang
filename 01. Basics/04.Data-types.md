# Data types

Programs generally create and manipulate data. It's important top understand different types of data that we can store in our program.


## Variables

- Variables are used to access data.

## Unitialized variable declaration

```go
var age int
fmt.Println(age)
```

## Initialized variable declaration

```go
var firstName = "saksham"
var lastName string = "Gupta"
```
- If we are initialzing variable, it's optional to specift type as it will infer from the value assigned.


## Shorthand

- No need to write `var` keyword and define the type as it will be infered from the value.

```go
count := 10
```

## Default values

- If we leave variables unitialized, they take a default value based on the data type.
