# Conditionals

## Simple if statement

```go
func main() {
	var age int = 25
	if age > 18 {
		fmt.Println("You are an adult")
	}
}
```

## If else

```go
func main() {
	var age int = 25
	if age > 18 {
		fmt.Println("You are an adult")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("You are not an adult")
	}
}

```

## If else if

```go
func main() {
	var age int = 59
	if age < 18 {
		fmt.Println("You are a kid")
	} else if age >= 18 && age < 50 {
		fmt.Println("You are an adult")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("You are getting older")
	}
}
```
- Only first matching condition block executes.
- Rest all the blocks are not checked.


## Switch

- Switch is more concide, readable and maintainable.
- Takes an expression and matches that expression value against multiple possible values.
- Only first match is considered. After match is found, that block executes and the switch terminates and control moves to next statement after switch.


## fallthrough

- Default switch workflow is that after a match is found, it executes the code block and terminates the switch.
- But if we want that even after a match is found, it should still evaluate rest of the cases, we can use `fallthrough` keyword.
