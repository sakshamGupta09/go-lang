# Conditionals

## Simple if statement

```go
func main() {
	var age int = 25
	if age > 18 {
		fmt.Println("You are an adult")
	}
}
```

## If else

```go
func main() {
	var age int = 25
	if age > 18 {
		fmt.Println("You are an adult")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("You are not an adult")
	}
}

```

## If else if

```go
func main() {
	var age int = 59
	if age < 18 {
		fmt.Println("You are a kid")
	} else if age >= 18 && age < 50 {
		fmt.Println("You are an adult")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("You are getting older")
	}
}
```
- Only first matching condition block executes.
- Rest all the blocks are not checked.


## Switch

- Concise syntax to enhance readability and maintainability.
- Expression is matched against case values. Once the expression matches, code block runs and switch is terminated. Further cases are not evaluated.
- If we want that even after we found a match we should still check against other switch case values, we need to write `fallthrough`
