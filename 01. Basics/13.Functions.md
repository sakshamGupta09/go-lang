# Functions

- To organise our long code into modular and reusable blocks that does exactly one thing based on single responsibility principle.
- It improved code readability and maintainability.

## Syntax

- func reserved keyword.
- name of the function. If it's a `public` function, it should be capitalCased. `Private` ones are lowercased.
- List of parameters with their types (p int, q string).
- Return type/s. Function can return multiple values.

```go
func greetUser(name string) string {
  fmt.Println("WELCOME", name)
}
```

## Anonymous functions

- Functions that do not have a name.
- We call these functions by assigning them to a variable first and then call them using variable.

```go
func main() {
	var result = func() {
		fmt.Println("Hello world")
	}
	result()
}
```

## IIFE

- A function that invokes itself while declaration.

```go
func main() {
	func() {
		fmt.Println("Hello world")
	}()
}
```

## Functions as types: First class citizens
