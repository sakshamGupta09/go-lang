# Init function

- Let's say we create a package. Whenever that package is first imported, some initialization happens.
- A special function that runs automatically during package initialization.
- Cannot be called manually and is available for any package.
- Executed only once per package even if the package is imported multiple times.
- There can be multiple init functions in one package. They are executed squentially in order they are written.


## Execution Order

When you run a Go program:

1️⃣ Imported packages initialize first
- package variables initialized
- their init() functions run

2️⃣ main package initializes
- variables initialized
- its init() runs

3️⃣ Finally → main() runs

```go
func init() {
	fmt.Println("INITIALIZER 1")
}

func init() {
	fmt.Println("INITIALIZER 2")
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(" MAIN")
}
```
