# Panic

- `panic` is Go’s way of saying: “This should never happen. and now there's no pint in going forward” 
- A mechanism used to handle unexpected, unrecoverable runtime errors after which program should simply stop executing.


## Common causes of panic

- Accessing an array/slice out of bounds
- Dereferencing a nil pointer
- Dividing by zero
- Explicitly calling panic()


## What happens when panic occurs?

- The current function stops execution immediately
- All deferred functions are executed (LIFO order)
- The program crashes and prints a stack trace
- Unless recovered, the program terminates
