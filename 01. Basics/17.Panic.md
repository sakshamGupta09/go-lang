# Panic

- `panic` is Go’s way of saying: “This should never have happen and now there's no pint in going forward”.
- Errors are expected like when we try to establiosh connection with a database or make a network call.
- A mechanism used to handle unexpected, unrecoverable runtime errors after which program cannot proceed safely.
- We can call `panic` with any type of argument(string, number, boolean).


## Common causes of panic

- Accessing an array/slice out of bounds
- Dereferencing a nil pointer
- Dividing by zero
- Explicitly calling panic()


## What happens when panic occurs?

- The current function stops execution immediately
- All deferred functions are executed (LIFO order)
- The program crashes and prints a stack trace
- Unless recovered, the program terminates

```go
func main() {
	process(-1)
	fmt.Println("After processing is done")
}

func process(i int) {
	defer fmt.Println("DEFER STATEMENT")
	if i < 0 {
		panic("Negative intergers are not allowed")
	}
	fmt.Println("Normal processing")
}
```
