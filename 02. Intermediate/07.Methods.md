# Custom types

- We create a custom type so that in future if the type of a variable is to be updated, we do it at only one place.
- Example phone number is updated from a string type to a struct which contains zip, country, dialCode.
- We can create methods not only on structs but any custom type.
- In the receiver, whatever type we pass, that method gets attached to the instance of the type.

```go
type TypeName int8

func (num TypeName) isPositive() bool {
	return num > 0
}
```
