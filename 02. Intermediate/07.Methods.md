# Custom types

- We create a custom type so that in future if the type of a variable is to be updated, we do it at only one place.
- Example phone number is updated from a string type to a struct which contains zip, country, dialCode.
- We can create methods not only on structs but any custom type.
- In the receiver, whatever type we pass, that method gets attached to the instance of the type.

```go
type TypeName int8

func (num TypeName) isPositive() bool {
	return num > 0
}

func main() {
	num := TypeName(3)
	fmt.Println("DIMENSIONS OF RECTANGLE IS ", num.isPositive())

}
```

- Inside the receiver function, its optional to create an instance of the type. If there is no need for the instance inside the methods body, we can omit it.

```go
func (TypeName) greetUser() string {
	return "WELOCOME TO JUMANJI"
}
```
