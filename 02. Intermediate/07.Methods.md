# Custom types

- We create a custom type so that in future if the type of a variable is to be updated, we do it at only one place.
- Example phone number is updated from a string type to a struct which contains zip, country, dialCode.
- We can create methods not only on structs but any custom type.
- In the receiver, whatever type we pass, that method gets attached to the instance of the type.

```go
type TypeName int8

func (num TypeName) isPositive() bool {
	return num > 0
}

func main() {
	num := TypeName(3)
	fmt.Println("DIMENSIONS OF RECTANGLE IS ", num.isPositive())

}
```

- Inside the receiver function, its optional to create an instance of the type. If there is no need for the instance inside the methods body, we can omit it.

```go
func (TypeName) greetUser() string {
	return "WELOCOME TO JUMANJI"
}
```

## Embedding and methods

- We have anonymous field declaration wherein key and value have the same names.
- Just like fields, methods are also promoted up to the outer struct in case of anonymous field embedding and we can directly access these properties.


```go
type Rectangle struct {
	length int
	width  int
}

type Shape struct {
	Rectangle
}

func (r Rectangle) calculateArea() int {
	return r.length * r.width
}

func main() {
	shape := Shape{
		Rectangle: Rectangle{
			length: 10,
			width:  20,
		},
	}

	fmt.Println(shape.length, shape.width, shape.calculateArea())
}
```
