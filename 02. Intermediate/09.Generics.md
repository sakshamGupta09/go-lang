# Generics

## Problem

- We are working with a stack data structure.
- It can be an integer, float, string or a boolean stack.
- How do we make our stack this flexible that it can support multiple data types without duplicating code and without losing type safety.


## Without generics

- We can use any type which can lead to runtime issues and losing type safety.
- We can duplicate our code to create integerStack, FloatStack etc
