# Generics

## Problem

- We are working with a stack data structure.
- It can be an integer, float, string or a boolean stack.
- How do we make our stack this flexible that it can support multiple data types without duplicating code and without losing type safety.


## Without generics

- We can use any type which can lead to runtime issues and losing type safety.
- We can duplicate our code to create integerStack, FloatStack etc


## Generics

- Generics lets us define functions and types that can work with multiple data types without duplication or losing type safety.

```go
func SumInts(a, b int) int {
	return a + b
}

func SumFloats(a, b float64) float64 {
	return a + b
}
```

```go
func add[T int | float64](a, b T) T {
	return a + b
}
```
