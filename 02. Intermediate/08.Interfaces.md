# Interfaces

- Interfaces are how Go does polymorphism.


## Problem statement

- Imagine we have structs called `Circle`, `Rectangle` and `Square`. They all have some properties and a method called `area` to calculate the area.
- Now, lets say we want to create a generic method called `calculateShapeArea` that takes a shape as argument and returns it's area.
- The problem now is how to define the type for this shape?

```go
type Rectangle struct {
	length float64
	width  float64
}

func (r Rectangle) area() float64 {
	return r.length * r.width
}

type Square struct {
	length float64
}

func (r Square) area() float64 {
	return r.length * r.length
}

type Circle struct {
	radius float64
}

func (r Circle) area() float64 {
	return math.Pi * r.radius * r.radius
}

func calculateShapeArea(shape Circle) float64 {
	return shape.area()
}
```

## Interface

```go
type Logger interface {
	Log(msg string)
}
```

- Any `struct` that will define this method will automatically be of type `Logger` witout explicitly specifying anywhere.
- `struct` may define additional methods and that si fine as long as the `Logger` method is present.
