# Embed directive

- How static files and directories(HTML templates, SQL Migration files, assets) are packaged and shipped.
- Since, Go produces a binary executable, the assets are also included in that executable only so at runtime we dont have to resolve the assets from seperate folders like in node.js
- If we include a heavy asset, the executable size will increase.


## Syntax

```go
import (
	_ "embed"
	"fmt"
)

//go:embed file.txt
var content string
```
- This tells Go that this file needs to be part of the executable produced.
- We are not directly using methods or types from `embed` package but indirectly so the blank import.
