# Embed directive

- How static files and directories(HTML templates, SQL Migration files, assets) are packaged and shipped.
- Go includes them inside compiled binary so your program can access them without depending on external files at runtime.


## Syntax

```go
import (
	_ "embed"
	"fmt"
)

//go:embed file.txt
var content string
```
