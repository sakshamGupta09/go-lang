# Logging

## Why

- Debugging Problems. If your app crashes in production, you can’t sit inside the server and see what happened.Logs tell you: What happened, When it happened, In what order it happened, What data was involved.
- Monitoring System Health. Logs help answer: Is the server running? Are requests failing? Is database slow? Are users getting errors?
- Security. Logs help detect: Repeated failed login attempts, Suspicious activity, Unauthorized access

## Log package

- We typically use `log` package for logging information.
- It automatically adds data and time top our logged information.
