# JSON

- JSON is a lightweight, text-based format used to store and exchange data.
- A common language computers use to share data. Works with JavaScript, Go, Python, Java, etc.

## Converting structs to JSON

- For every `struct` field, we need to define corresponsing JSON field in backticks.
- This is useful because our struct might be public and so we need to make the fields capitalCase. But in JSON, we might be following different naming conventions.
