# JSON

- JSON is a lightweight, text-based format used to store and exchange data.
- A common language computers use to share data. Works with JavaScript, Go, Python, Java, etc.

## Converting structs to JSON

- For every `struct` field, we need to define corresponsing JSON field in backticks.
- This is useful because our struct might be public and so we need to make the fields capitalCase. But in JSON, we might be following different naming conventions.

```go
type Person struct {
	Name string `json:"name"`
	Age  int    `json:"age"`
}

func main() {
	person := Person{Name: "John Doe", Age: 28}

	jsonData, err := json.Marshal(person)

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("ERROR::", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println(string(jsonData))
}
```
