# Hashing

- Some information is extremely sensitive to be stored as plain text like a user's password. If our DB gets compromised, attacker will have access to all passwords.
- We never store such information as plain text but we hash it.
- In GO, we have `crypto/sha256` and `crypto/sha512` packages which provide us with hash functions.
