# Hashing

- Some information is extremely sensitive to be stored as plain text like a user's password. If our DB gets compromised, attacker will have access to all passwords.
- We never store such information as plain text but we hash it.
- In GO, we have `crypto/sha256` and `crypto/sha512` packages which provide us with hash functions.


## Create hash

- Input is a byte slice and output is a bytes array.

```go
password := "password123"

hash256 := sha256.Sum256([]byte(password))
```
