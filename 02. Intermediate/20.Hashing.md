# Hashing

- Some information is extremely sensitive to be stored as plain text like a user's password. If our DB gets compromised, attacker will have access to all passwords.
- We never store such information as plain text but we hash it.
- In GO, we have `crypto/sha256` and `crypto/sha512` packages which provide us with hash functions.


## Create hash

- Input is a byte slice and output is a bytes array.

```go
password := "password123"

hash256 := sha256.Sum256([]byte(password))
```
```go
password := "password123"

hash512 := sha512.Sum512([]byte(password))
```

## Salting

- If two users have the same password and you hash it normally, it will produce the same hash.
- Rainbow table attacks. Attackers have a list of precomputed hashes. So, if the hashes match, they can retrieve the password.
- Same password → same hash leaks information. Attacker knows that these all users with same has have the same passwords.
- One attack breaks everyone. If a attacker can break one password, all systems using that password are vulnerable.
