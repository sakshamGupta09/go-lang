# Epoch

- It is the number of seconds (or milliseconds, etc.) that have passed since a fixed starting point.
- `January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC`
- Epoch is always UTC.
- Negative values means before epoch time.


## Convert time to unix epoch

- `time.unix` returns int64 value which reprersents how many seconds have passed since epoch time.

```go
func main() {
	t := time.Now()

	timeUnix := t.Unix()

	fmt.Println(timeUnix)
}
```
