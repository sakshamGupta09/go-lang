# Pointers

- Pointer is a variable that stores memory address of another variable.
- Using pointers, we can directly go at a memory location and update the value there. So, any variable pointing to that address will not have a new value.


## Declaration

- We prefix the types with a star indicating this is a pointer that will hold memory address of that particular type of variable.
- We have different pointer types based on type of variable whose address they are storing.

```go
var ptr *int
var namePtr *string
```
- Pointer's zero value is `nil`

## Initialization

```go
var a int = 10
var name string = "John"

var ptr *int = &a
var namePtr *string = &name
```

## Accessing value stored at memory location

- Dereferencing operator
- * pointerVariable

```go
func main() {

	var a int = 10
	var name string = "John"

	var ptr *int = &a

	var namePtr *string = &name

	fmt.Println(*ptr, *namePtr)

}
```

## Passing pointers to functions

- Since we are dealing with memory addresses, we are directly updating memory and any variable refering to that location will have a new value.
- This is unlike pass by value where a copy of a value is created and passed to a function. We can mutate the copy but original value remains unchanged.

```go
func main() {
	var a int = 10
	fmt.Println("BEFORE", a)

	modifyValue(&a)
	fmt.Println("AFTER", a)
}

func modifyValue(ptr *int) {
	*ptr++
}
```
