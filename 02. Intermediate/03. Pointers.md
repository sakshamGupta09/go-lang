# Pointers

- Pointer is a variable that stores memory address of another variable.
- Using pointers, we can directly go at a memory location and update the value there. So, any variable pointing to that address will not have a new value.


## Declaration

- We prefix the types with a star indicating this is a pointer that will hold memory address of that particular type of variable.
- We have different pointer types based on type of variable whose address they are storing.

```go
var ptr *int
var namePtr *string
```
- Pointer's zero value is `nil`

## Initialization

```go
var a int = 10
var name string = "John"

var ptr *int = &a
var namePtr *string = &name
```
