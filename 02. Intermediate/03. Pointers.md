# Pointers

- Pointer is a variable that stores memory address of another variable.
- We have different pointer types based on type of variable whose address they are storing.


## Declaration

- We prefix the types with a star indicating this is a pointer that will hold memory address of that particular type of variable.

```go
	var ptr *int
	var namePtr *string
```
- Pointer's zero value is `nil`
