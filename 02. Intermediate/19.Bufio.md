# Bufio Package

## Buffering

- When a program reads data from a source like `disk`,  `keyboard`, `network`, `file` it must ask the operating system for data.
- OS calls are slow compared to normal memory access.
- Buffering = collecting data in advance and keeping it in main memory so we don’t have to fetch it again and again from OS.
