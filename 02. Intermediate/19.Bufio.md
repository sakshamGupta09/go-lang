# Bufio Package

## Buffering

- I want to read a 10GB file located on my computer through my GO program. 
- To do so, I need to make repeated OS calls. OS calls are slow compared to normal memory access.
- Buffering = collecting data in advance and keeping it in main memory (buffer) so we don’t have to fetch it again and again from OS.


## How to create a bufio.Reader

```go
reader := bufio.NewReader(source)
```
- source can be File, os.Stdin, Network connection, Any io.Reader



## Read(p []byte)

- Read these many bytes from the source and store it into the target which is a byte slice.

```go
data := make([]byte, 5)
reader.Read(data)
```


## ReadString(delim byte)

- Reads from the source until delimiter is found.

```go
line, err := reader.ReadString('\n')
```
