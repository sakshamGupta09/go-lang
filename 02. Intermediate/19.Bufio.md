# Bufio Package

## Buffering

- I want to read a 10GB file located on my computer through my GO program. 
- To do so, I need to make repeated OS calls. OS calls are slow compared to normal memory access.
- Buffering = collecting data in advance and keeping it in main memory (buffer) so we don’t have to fetch it again and again from OS.


## How to create a bufio.Reader

```go
reader := bufio.NewReader(source)
```
- source can be File, os.Stdin, Network connection, Any io.Reader.
- Once it starts reading, it remembers its position and when asked to read again, it continues from the leftover position.



## Read(p []byte) bytes read, err

- Read these many bytes from the source and store it into the target which is a byte slice.
- It returns number of bytes read successfully.

```go
reader := bufio.NewReader(dataSource)

target := make([]byte, 20)

numberOfBytes, err := reader.Read(target)

if err != nil {
  fmt.Println("Error while reading the file", err)
  return;
}
fmt.Println("READ these many bytes", numberOfBytes)
```


## ReadString(delim byte)

- Reads from the source until delimiter is found.
- Delimiter is also included.

```go

reader := bufio.NewReader(dataSource)

line, err := reader.ReadString('.')

if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error while reading the file", err)
		return
}
fmt.Println("READ these many bytes", line)
```

## Bufio.Writer

- Keep accumulating data chunks and then write that chunk rather than writing every line.
- Used for writing to big files like geneerating CSV, reports, store logs.
- Mention the target location where we want to write the contents.

```go
writer := bufio.NewWriter(os.Stdout)
```

## writer.Write(byte slice) numberOfBytes, err

- I have a byte slice and I want to write it's content.
