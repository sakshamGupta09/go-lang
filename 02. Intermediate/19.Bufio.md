# Bufio Package

## Buffering

- I want to read a 10GB file located on my computer through my GO program. 
- To do so, I need to make repeated OS calls. OS calls are slow compared to normal memory access.
- Buffering = collecting data in advance and keeping it in main memory so we don’t have to fetch it again and again from OS.


## bufio.Reader

- Read data efficiently by buffering input. Instead of reading small chunks directly from a data source(which is slow because it involves system calls), it reads a large chunk into memory and then serves smaller reads from that buffer.
