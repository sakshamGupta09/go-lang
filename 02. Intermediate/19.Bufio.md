# Bufio Package

## Buffering

- I want to read a 10GB file located on my computer through my GO program. 
- To do so, I need to make repeated OS calls. OS calls are slow compared to normal memory access.
- Buffering = collecting data in advance and keeping it in main memory (buffer) so we don’t have to fetch it again and again from OS.


## bufio.Reader

- Read data efficiently by buffering input. Instead of reading small chunks directly from a data source(which is slow because it involves system calls), it reads a large chunk into memory and then serves smaller reads from that buffer.
- `bufio.Reader` is a struct from the bufio package that wraps another reader (like a file, socket, or os.Stdin) and provides Faster reading, Convenient reading methods, Ability to read line-by-line or byte-by-byte.

## How to create a bufio.Reader

```go
reader := bufio.NewReader(source)
```
- source can be File, os.Stdin, Network connection, Any io.Reader
