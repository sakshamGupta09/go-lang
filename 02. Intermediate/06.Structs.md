# Structs

- A real world entity can have multiple attributes. Like a user can have `name`, `age`, `email` and so on.
- A struct is composite type that groups multiple fields under one name.


## Declaring a struct

- Structs should be declared at package level.
- We define te structure of our entity, a blueprint following which we can create multiple instances.

```go
type Person struct {
	firstName string
	lastName  string
	age       int8
}
```
