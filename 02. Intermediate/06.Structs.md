# Structs

- A real world entity can have multiple attributes. Like a user can have `name`, `age`, `email` and so on.
- A struct is composite type that groups multiple fields under one name.


## Declaring a struct

- Structs should be declared at package level.
- We define te structure of our entity, a blueprint following which we can create multiple instances.

```go
type Person struct {
	firstName string
	lastName  string
	age       int8
}
```

## Initialization

```go
func main() {
	p := Person{
		firstName: "John",
		lastName:  "Doe",
		age:       25,
	}

	fmt.Println(p)
}
```
- It's okay to omit some fields while initializing a struct type.
- If we don not initialize a field, it gets initialized with zero value of that type.


## Accessing fields

- Dot notation


## Anonymous structs

```go
user := struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}{
    Name: "Saksham",
    Age:  28,
}

```

## Structs are passed by value

```go
func main() {
	p := Person{
		firstName: "John",
		lastName:  "Doe",
		age:       31,
	}

	q := p
	q.firstName = "Q"

	fmt.Println(p.firstName, q.firstName)
}
```

## Methods

- Should be declared at package level and outside the struct.
- Struct instances are able to access this method and automatically receive a copy of the instance in receiver function. Modifying this copy will not change original instance as structs are passed by value.

```go
func (p Person) greetUser() string {
	p.firstName = "James"
	p.lastName = "Murr"

	return p.firstName + p.lastName
}
```


## Pointer receiver

- To modify struct fields inside a method.
