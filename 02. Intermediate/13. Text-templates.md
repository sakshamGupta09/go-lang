# Text templates

- Templates lets us generate dynamic text from data in a safe, structured, and maintainable way.
- Like a order receipt after a user has placed an order, or a text that generates a new set of credentials for the user.
- We create the dynamic text with placeholder values that will be replaced by data later.
