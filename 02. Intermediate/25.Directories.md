# Directories

- Work with directories programatically. Create, read, delete and navigate.
- `os` package lets us interact with directories.


## Create directories

- When creating directory, we need to specify permission to OS about Who can read, write, or enter this directory?
- If directory with name already exists, it throws an error.

```go
err := os.Mkdir("study-folder", 0755)
```

## Creating files

```go
	err = os.WriteFile("study-folder/readme", []byte("Hello World!"), 0755)
```
