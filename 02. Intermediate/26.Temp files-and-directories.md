# Temporary files

## Why

- Imagine someone uploads a 5GB file. If you try to keep all of it in memory (RAM), your program might crash. Instead, Save it to a temporary file, Process it piece by piece, Delete it after.
- Suppose you are updating an important file. If your program crashes halfway, the file may become broken. Better way: Write the new content into a temp file and When everything succeeds → replace the original file. If something goes wrong, the original file is still safe.
