# Random numbers

- There are some applications where random numbers are useful like Ludo or dice games.


## rand.Intn()

- It generates a pseudo random positive integer between 0 and num-1.


```go
func main() {
	fmt.Println(rand.Intn(10))
}
```

- To generate a number between a lower and upper bound. Example in dice games we need numbers from 1 to 6 only.

```go
func main() {
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		fmt.Println(rand.Intn(6) + 1)
	}
}

```
