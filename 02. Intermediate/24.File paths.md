# File paths

- Different OS use different path formats. `filepath` ensures paths are built and parsed correctly for the current OS.
- While reading and writing files we may need to construct a path first to be able to reach that target location.


## filepath.Join()

- It combines components of a path by a seperator depending upon the current OS.

```go
joinedPath := filepath.Join("Desktop", "Projects", "readme.md")

fmt.Println(joinedPath)
```
