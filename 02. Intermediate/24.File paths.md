# File paths

- Different OS use different path formats. `filepath` ensures paths are built and parsed correctly for the current OS.
- While reading and writing files we may need to construct a path first to be able to reach that target location.


## filepath.Join()

- It combines components of a path by a seperator depending upon the current OS.
- We should always construct paths using this method for OS compatibility.

```go
joinedPath := filepath.Join("Desktop", "Projects", "readme.md")

fmt.Println(joinedPath) // Desktop/Projects/readme.md
```

## filepath.clean()

- It removes redundant components from the path.

```go
func main() {
	path := filepath.Clean("./data/../data/file.txt")

	fmt.Println(path) // data/file.txt
}
```
