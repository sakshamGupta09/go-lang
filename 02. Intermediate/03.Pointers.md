# Pointers

- A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

## Why Pointers

## 1️⃣ Modify original data (instead of a copy)

- Go passes everything by value. Which means, it always creates a copy and that copy is passed to a function.
- Pointer lets a function update the original variable and not the copy.
