# Pointers

- A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

## Why Pointers

## 1️⃣ Modify original data (instead of a copy)

- Go passes everything by value. Which means, it always creates a copy and that copy is passed to a function.
- Pointer lets a function update the original variable and not the copy.


Without Pointers

```go
func increment(n int) {
	n++
}

x := 5
increment(x)
fmt.Println(x) // 5
```

With Pointers

```go
func increment(n *int) {
	*n++
}

x := 5
increment(&x)
fmt.Println(x) // 6
```

## 2️⃣ Avoid copying large data (performance)

- Go passes everything by value by default.
- So, if we have a large `struct`, entire struct will eb copied which can be bad for performance.
