# Closures

- A function is able to retain access to its lexical (enclosing) scope, even after that surrounding function has finished executing.
- Encapsulation as data and methods that update that data are together.
- It also lets us creates private state which is not accessible to outside world.


```go
func main() {
	counterFn := counter()
}

func counter() func() int {
	count := 0

	return func() int {
		count++
		return count
	}
}
```

- Whenever counter is called, it returns a function that can access `count` state variable and read it's value.
