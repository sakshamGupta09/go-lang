# Recursion

- Breaks down a problem into subproblems of same type until they become simple enough to solve directly.
- There must be a base case where a function stops calling itself and returns a value(solution to the simplest problem).
- There is a recursive case where a function calls itself to break the problem into subproblems and reach towards the base case.


## Factorial of a number

```go
func factorial(n int) int {
	if n == 0 || n == 1 {
		return 1
	}
	return n * factorial(n-1)
}

```
