# String formatting

- We want a formatted output.


## Padded outputs

- We want the output string to always take atleast n characters.
- If it has more than that fine, but if it has less than minimum required, we pad some extra characters to make it bgger.
- For numbers, we can add zeroes before the actual value. For strings, we can add spaces to teh left or right, doesn't matters.

```go
func main() {
	num := 44
	fmt.Printf("%05d\n", num) // 00044
}

func main() {
	num := 4444444
	fmt.Printf("%05d\n", num) // 4444444
}
```
Strings

```go
func main() {
	message := "Hello"
	fmt.Printf("|%10s|\n", message) // |     Hello|
}

func main() {
	message := "Hello"
	fmt.Printf("|%-10s|\n", message) // |Hello     |
}
```


## Raw string literals

- Strings are created using double quotes or backticks.
- Raw string literals does not respect escape sequences like `\n`, `\t` and `\r`. They treat them as two different characters.
- Useful for regular expressions and SQL queries where we do not want go compiler to interpret special characters as something else.
