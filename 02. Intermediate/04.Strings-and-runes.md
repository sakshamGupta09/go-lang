# Strings

- String is a sequence of characters. Each character is a unsigned int8 value.
- Strings are immutable. Once created they cannot be modified. We have to create a new string if we need to modify a string.


## Double quotes vs Raw string literal (Backticks)

- There are two ways to store a string value. Using double quotes and back ticks. Single quotes does not work.

## Escape sequences

- `\n` New Line, `\t` Tab space, `\r` Carriage return which moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line.
- Raw string literal does not resepct escape characters. It just treates them as another character.
