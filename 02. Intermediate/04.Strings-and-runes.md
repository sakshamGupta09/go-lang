# Strings

- String is a sequence of characters. Each character is a unsigned int8 value which is called a Rune
- Strings are immutable. Once created they cannot be modified. We have to create a new string if we need to modify a string.


## Double quotes vs Raw string literal (Backticks)

- There are two ways to store a string value. Using double quotes and back ticks. Single quotes does not work.

## Escape sequences

- `\n` New Line, `\t` Tab space, `\r` Carriage return which moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line.
- Raw string literal does not resepct escape characters. It just treates them as another character.


```go
func main() {
	name := "John \n Doe"
	name2 := `John \n Doe`

	fmt.Println(name)
	fmt.Println(name2)

	/*
		  John
		  Doe
	    John \n Doe
	*/

}
```

```go
func main() {
	name := "John \t Doe"
	name2 := `John \t Doe`

	fmt.Println(name)
	fmt.Println(name2)

	/*
		John     Doe
	  John \t Doe	*/

}

```

```go
func main() {
	name := "John\rDoe"
	name2 := `John \r Doe`

	fmt.Println(name)
	fmt.Println(name2)

	/*
	Doen
	John \r Doe
	*/

}
```

## len

- We can use the `len` function to calculate length of a string.
- If using double quotes, escape sequence is considered one character.
- However, with raw string literal escape sequences are considered two seperate characters `\` and `n`.

```go
func main() {
	name := "John\nDoe"
	name2 := `John\rDoe`

	fmt.Println(len(name))
	fmt.Println(len(name2))

	/*
		8
		11
	*/

}
```
