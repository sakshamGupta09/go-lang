# Fmt package

- **Printing** → output to terminal or strings
- **Formatting** → control how values appear
- **Scanning** → read input from user or other sources


## Printing functions

## Print

- No spaces added if we print multiple values.
- No newline at the end. Cursor stays at same line.
- Concatenates values.

```go
func main() {
	fmt.Print("hello", "world", 5) // helloworld5 10%        
}
```

## Println

- Prints the values.
- Adds spaces between them for better readability.
- Takes teh cursor to new line.

```go
func main() {
	fmt.Println("hello", "world", 5) // hello world 5
}
```


## Printf

- Prints formatted output using formatting verbs.
- Does NOT add newline automatically.

```go
name := "Saksham"
age := 28
fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", name, age)

```


## Formatting functions

- Printing functions logs something to the console.
- Formatting functions do not log anything but return a formatted string instead.
- They can be used for string concatenation purpose as well.

## Sprint

- Works same was as `Print` but returns a string and not logs anything to console.
