# Environment Variables

- Environment variables are key–value pairs stored outside your program that provide configurations to our program without hardcoding them in code.
- They are set in the OS environment, not inside your Go code.


## Use cases

- Keep configuration outside code. Now you can change the port without changing or rebuilding the code.
- Different configs for different environments
- Better Security. So secrets are not committed to Git, are not visible in source code, Can be managed securely by the deployment system.
