# Environment Variables

- Environment variables are key–value pairs stored outside your program that provide configurations to our program without hardcoding them in code.
- They are set in the OS environment, not inside your Go code.


## Use cases

- Keep configuration outside code. Now you can change the port without changing or rebuilding the code.
- Different configs for different environments
- Better Security. So secrets are not committed to Git, are not visible in source code, Can be managed securely by the deployment system.


## Read environment variables

```go
func main() {
	var user = os.Getenv("USER")
	var home = os.Getenv("HOME")

	fmt.Println(user)
	fmt.Println(home)
}
```

## Reading all environment variables

- We have a menthod called `environ` that returns a string slice.
- The string contains key and value seperated by a `=`.

```go
func main() {
	for _, v := range os.Environ() {
		fmt.Println(v)
	}
}
```

## Set environment variable

```go
os.Setenv("FRUIT", "APPLE")
```
