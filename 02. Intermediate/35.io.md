# IO Package

- It's a standard library package used for reading data from a source and writing data to a destination.


## io.Reader interface

- When we read data, that data is stored in a byte slice.
- Read function returns number of bytes read and an error.
- It's possible that the content is shorter than 1024 bytes or 1 KB. So we have to make use of number of bytes read.
