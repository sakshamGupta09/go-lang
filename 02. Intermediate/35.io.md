# IO Package

- It's a standard library package used for reading data from a source and writing data to a destination.


## io.Reader interface

- When we read data, that data is stored in a byte slice. We are telling reader to go and read this much of data from the source.
- Read function returns number of bytes read and an error.
- It's possible that the content is shorter than 1024 bytes or 1 KB. So we have to make use of number of bytes read.

```go
func readFromSource(r io.Reader) {
	data := make([]byte, 1024)

	n, err := r.Read(data)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Error while reading data", err)
	}

	fmt.Println(string(data[:n]))
}
```
